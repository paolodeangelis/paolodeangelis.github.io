abstract: With the advent of Industry 4.0, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created a favorable environment for the digitalization of manufacturing and processing, helping industries to automate and optimize operations. In this work, we focus on a practical case study of a brake caliper quality control operation, which is usually accomplished by human inspection and requires a dedicated handling system, with a slow production rate and thus inefficient energy usage. We report on a developed Machine Learning (ML) methodology, based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (D-CNNs), to automatically extract information from images, to automate the process. A complete workflow has been developed on the target industrial test case. In order to find the best compromise between accuracy and computational demand of the model, several D-CNNs architectures have been tested. The results show that, a judicious choice of the ML model with a proper training, allows a fast and accurate quality control; thus, the proposed workflow could be implemented forÂ an ML-powered version of the considered problem. This would eventually enable a better management of the available resources, in terms of time consumption and energy usage.
