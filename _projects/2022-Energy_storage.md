description: With this repository our "Energy Storage" master's course now offers Jupyter notebooks to teach students
             how to use Python for engineering analysis and simulate Lithium-Ion batteries (LIB) using models
             like Pseudo 2-Dimensional (P2D).
             Students gain hands-on experience to understand battery physics and apply it to real-world engineering
             problems. These user-friendly notebooks help students improve coding skills and prepare for a
             successful career in Energy Engineering.
