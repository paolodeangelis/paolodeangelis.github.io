description: VIMMP is a project aimed at promoting innovation in European manufacturing industry through the 
             exchange of materials modelling. It establishes an open-source web-based marketplace that connects 
             different manufacturing industry sectors with relevant materials modelling activities and resources, 
             integrating modelling platforms based on Open Simulation Platform (OSP) standards.

# VIMMP

**Virtual Materials Market Place** (VIMMP) is a project that aims to create a user-friendly web-based marketplace to promote the exchange between materials modeling stakeholders, including manufacturing end-users, software owners, and communities. 
The platform is built on solid taxonomy and metadata foundations, enabling the translation of scientific problems into modeling workflows and integrating modeling platforms based on Open Simulation Platform (OSP) standards. 
The project will develop data repositories, including a novel input parameter repository for mesoscopic model, materials properties, and associated validation data, and education and training resources. 
VIMMP will validate its novel avenues for coupling and linking of models in the context of three overlapping industry applications: personal goods, polymer nanocomposites, and functional coatings. Ultimately, VIMMP aims to lower risk and upfront cost, increase the speed and agility of deploying materials modeling, and realize a wide range of demonstrated economic impacts in European manufacturing industries.

My main contribution to the VIMMP project was developing a multiscale model to calculate the thermophysical effects of carbon-based solid additives in the plastic mixture of tire comme at the atomistic scale. 
This was a critical aspect of one of the project's case studies, and helped to advance our understanding of the materials and processes involved in tire manufacturing
