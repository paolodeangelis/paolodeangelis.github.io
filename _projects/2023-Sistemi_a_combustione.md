description: "This repository enhances our \"Sistemi a Combustione\" (English: Combustion Systems) master's course by providing Jupyter notebooks to educate students in utilizing Python for engineering tasks. It demonstrates how advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) tools can be effectively applied in engineering problems. Specifically, we showcase examples of applications for Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Reinforcement Learning (RL)."
