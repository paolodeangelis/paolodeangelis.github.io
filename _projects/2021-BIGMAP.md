# BIG-MAP

The **Battery Interface Genome â€“ Materials Acceleration Platform** (BIG-MAP) project is a part of the [**BATTERY 2030+**](https://battery2030.eu/) European research initiative aimed at revolutionizing battery innovation through a radical paradigm shift. 
The goal is to dramatically speed up the battery discovery and innovation time, achieving a 5-10 fold increase relative to the current rate of discovery within the next 5-10 years. 
This will be accomplished through the development of a unique R&D infrastructure and accelerated methodology that integrates insights from leading experts, competencies, and data across the entire battery discovery value chain. 
BIG-MAP will use [Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), [High-Performance Computing (HPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing), large-scale and high-throughput characterization, and autonomous synthesis robotics to reinvent the way we invent batteries. 
The aim is to develop core modules and Key Demonstrators of a Materials Acceleration Platform specifically designed for accelerated discovery of battery materials and interfaces.

I was involved in the European project in Work Package 3 (WP3), which focus was on developing [multiscale models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiscale_modeling) capable of describing materials and phenomena at various resolutions, i.e. from electronic to continuous. 
Specifically, I worked on characterizing the [Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-018-0064-0), which is a thin passivation layer formed between the anode and electrolyte in batteries. 
To achieve this, I employed [Density Functional Theory (DFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory) codes to perform quantum simulations, and then used the resulting interaction data to parameterize the [ReaxFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReaxFF) reactive potential, which enabled me to model SEI behavior at the atomistic scale using [Molecular Dynamics (MD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) simulations.
