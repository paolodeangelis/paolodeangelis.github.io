- title: BSc in Mechanical Engineering, Politecnico di Torino, IT
  from: 2012
  to: 2017
  description: I completed my Mechanical Engineering course held in Italian, and I earned a BSc degree with a grade of 107
               with a thesis titled <i>"<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion'>Quaternion</a> application to 3D roto-translation on simulative environment."</i>

- title: Apprentice worker, Real Due s.a.s., IT
  from: 2009
  to: 2012
  description: During the summer breaks, I worked as an apprentice in a job shop, 
               I helped produce intermediate materials and drew components for external suppliers, 
               gaining experience with manual drilling machines, MIG welders, and bandsaws. 
               I also learned to carry out basic tasks like bearing mounting, assembly, and electrical motor maintenance.
