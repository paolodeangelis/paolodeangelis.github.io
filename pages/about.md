# **About Me**

Hi I am **Paolo** :wave:,

As a materials modeling researcher at the [**Politecnico di Torino**](https://www.polito.it/), I specialize in applying computational methods to energy materials. <br>
My PhD, which I earned *cum laude* in 2022, focused on reactive and non-reactive interface modeling for energy materials.
My educational background is in mechanical engineering, but I have cultivated expertise in mathematics and materials physics throughout my studies.

Programming is a critical component of my work, and I have developed proficiency in several coding languages. [**Python**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) is my preferred language due to its extensive community and the ease with which it can be used to wrap high-performance codes for use on [**High-Performance Computing** (HPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing) systems. I am experienced in modeling at various space-time scales, but I am particularly drawn to discrete models, such as [**Molecular Dynamics** (MD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) and [**Density Functional Theory** (DFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory) models.
In recent years, I have leveraged my experience in GPU computing to build and train [**Neural Networks** (NN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) models, with a focus on NN Force Fields for MD simulations and [**Machine Learning** (ML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) tools for material discovery.

My passion for exploring new computational tools and modeling techniques has enabled me to stay at the forefront of my field, and I am trying to push, together with all the other colleagues, the boundaries of human knowledge ðŸš€.
