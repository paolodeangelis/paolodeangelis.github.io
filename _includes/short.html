            <p align="justify">
            My passion for the <strong><em>Beauty</em></strong> is the driving force behind my work. As Dante wrote in Canto XXVI of his Inferno, <i>"Consider your origin: \ you were not made to live as brutes, \ but to follow virtue and knowledge."</i> 
            I believe this to be true in all aspects of life. 
            I constantly seek to understand and appreciate the Beautiful in everything around me, from the physical world of atoms, materials, and all the phenomena to the complexity of the human experience.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
            Through my work, I strive to understand the intricacies of the natural world using the powerful lens of mathematical models, from the discrete atomistic scale to the continuous one. As I delve deeper into these models, I am continually awed by the intricate elegance and awe-inspiring complexity of our world. 
            But I do not stop there.
            I also explore the emotional impact of color, light, and shape of matters through the mediums of drawing and painting, deepening the comprehension of what I see and feel, allowing me to appreciate the power of beauty that moves and inspires us.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
            My approach to seeking the <strong><em>Beautiful</em></strong> has the side effect of keeping both hemispheres of my brain active at all times, allowing me to engage with the world from a unique perspective that combines analytical rigor with creative intuition. 
            <br>
            At least, that is my idea and hope.
            </p>
